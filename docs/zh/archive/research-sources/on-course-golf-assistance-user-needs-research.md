# On-Course Golf Assistance and Real-Time Feedback: User Needs Research

**Research Date:** December 9, 2025
**Focus:** Virtual caddy/on-course AI assistant needs during actual play (not practice)

---

## Executive Summary

This research explores user needs for on-course golf assistance technologies, specifically "virtual caddy" or "on-course AI assistant" features that provide club recommendations, real-time feedback after shots, course management help, and coaching during actual rounds. The research reveals significant pain points in transferring practice performance to on-course play, limitations in existing tools, and specific features users wish existed.

## 1. Pain Points: Transferring Practice to Actual Play

### The Core Transfer Problem

**Fundamental Gap:**
- "One of the most common phrases spoken by golfers is, 'I was hitting it so well on the range, and then I got on the course and all hell broke loose.' Some version of this conversation is going on right now all around the world. Golfers are absolutely perplexed why they can't hit the same shots during a round than they do when they are practicing."

**Why the Gap Exists:**

1. **Environmental Differences**
   - "The practice facility is a static, constant environment, usually with flat or preferred lies, and a solo target. Hitting lots of shots to one target (called block practicing) can be an effective way to build a new motor pattern, but transferring that move to a dynamic, ever-changing environment like the course isn't always a quick adjustment."
   - "Golf courses present a variety of challenges that you won't encounter at a range. For example, the undulating terrain, changing wind conditions, and varied grass types all impact your shots in ways not present in a driving range."

2. **Lack of Consequences**
   - "A lot of it is lack of consequence. Even if you pick a target on the range whether you hit it or not is of no consequence. On the course every shot has a consequence - missing a fairway off the tee, missing a green or missing a putt."

3. **Pressure and Mental Factors**
   - "Most golfers don't feel pressure when they are hitting balls on the range or practicing off the course. The moment we are in a group of friends and need to make a putt to win a friendly match, the pressure is on."
   - "It's all mental. There's no pressure on the practice ground as compared to the course and so you tend to relax whereas on the course, you tense up."

4. **Surface/Equipment Differences**
   - "The range in my opinion flatters your ball striking. A slightly fat shot off the mat will still produce a good/reasonable shot, whereas you would be punished for a similar shot on the course."
   - "Turf interaction matters; if your driving range is mats only, it's hard to carry all that you are learning out to the golf course."

5. **Volume vs. Specificity Trade-off**
   - "If you shoot 80, you're unlikely to hit more than 40 long shots in a round. Besides your Driver, you are unlikely to hit the same club more than 2-3 times in a 4-hour period. 2-3 repetitions with a 9-iron isn't going to make you much better with a 9-iron. This practice is highly specific but doesn't have enough volume to see your golf improve."

6. **Motor Pattern Development Time**
   - "Motor patterns take a long time to integrate. Changing a complete motor pattern, or the way your body is firing muscles, takes a long time to memorize into autonomic memory. To create a pattern that is 'thoughtless' or some might say 'muscle memory' really does take an exorbitant amount of time. Don't expect what you learned on Tuesday, plus 50 practice swings on the range, to operate on the golf course Friday afternoon."

### Mental Game Differences

**Pressure Under Competition:**
- "Choking, or succumbing to pressure is a feeling most golfers have experienced. It isn't pleasant. The anxious and insecure feelings that often precede a choke arise from the fact you have attached your wellbeing and value to the outcome of the tournament. The ego feels threatened by the possibility of failure and the imagined consequences, and the 'fight or flight' response most golfers are familiar with results—snakes in the stomach, tightness in the muscles, sweaty palms and a racing heart. It's hard to play your best golf when you are shaking and your mind is all over the place."

**Tournament vs Casual Play:**
- "Mental preparation is key in tournaments as they're very different from a casual round of golf with your friends. In a tournament you're paired with new players, play in more difficult conditions, and have to abide by the rules of golf."

**Research Findings:**
- "In 2024, adidas undertook an initiative to analyze how athletes deal with pressure. Among the athletes who participated in the study were breakthrough golf talents Ludvig Åberg and Rose Zhang. It was found that high-stakes putts from ten feet or less created more pressure while playing, whereas long-distance putts allowed the golfers to focus more and stay at ease."

## 2. Existing On-Course Assistance Tools and Their Limitations

### Major Players in On-Course Assistance Apps

#### Arccos Caddie

**Features:**
- "For shot-tracking and data analysis, the Arccos Caddie app is hard to beat."
- "Working in tandem with Arccos' Smart Sensors, Arccos caddie offers a ton of data that you can look at and use to help you play your best golf. The application automatically tracks your shots and data and gives advice on how to strategize around a golf course."
- "After logging five or more rounds, Arccos gets truly familiar with your game."
- "Arccos uses a wide variety of inputs to provide a golfer with real-time insights into their optimal and alternative strategies."
- "Recommended strategies on every hole that adapt to your strengths, with score probability for each one, plus real-time yardage adjustments, club recommendations and advanced analytics."

**Limitations and Complaints:**

1. **Phone/Bluetooth Issues**
   - "If you're using Arccos you can't simultaneously connect to a Bluetooth speaker and listen to music."
   - "You can't connect to a speaker or earbuds to play music during your round because it is using your phone's mic."
   - "The phone in the front pocket is a common problem for users."

2. **Sensor Problems**
   - "Some users have trouble with sensors coming off, constantly having to screw them back in because the hole at the club end is enlarged by the sensor."
   - "The system gets most shots but is about 50/50 on putts. The superstroke sensor attachment barely works."

3. **Accuracy Issues**
   - "The caddy feature doesn't factor wind direction correctly, recommending too much club on downwind holes and not enough on holes into the wind."
   - "The data that Arccos Caddie provides is not as granular or malleable as Shot Scope. For the player who wants to get into the weeds of their performance, Arccos Caddie is limited."

4. **Lighting Limitations**
   - "Because the Arccos sensors use UV light to wake-up, it takes a hole or two before there is enough light for the system to work during early morning rounds. Golfers playing super twilight should be aware of this limitation."

5. **Apple Watch Issues**
   - "The Apple Watch app has been described as 'beyond awful,' registering maybe two shots all round with a clunky sync process."
   - "The Apple Watch battery drains significantly - from fully charged to 40% after one round."

6. **Cost Concerns**
   - "Purchasing the sensors gives you one free year of the Arccos Caddie app, but subsequent years cost $99/year."
   - "The Caddie Link accessory costs an additional $99."

7. **General Reliability**
   - "Some users report it's great when it works flawlessly but rarely does in their experience. They get fed up with sensors not working and found the caddie to not be very smart."

8. **Data Requirements**
   - "For Arccos Caddie to have the necessary shot data to provide off the tee recommendations, players must play the equivalent of five 18-hole rounds with Arccos."

#### Tangent Golf

**Features:**
- "The more you play and practice, the more data the caddie has to make course management suggestions tailored to your game."
- "AI Caddie uses course knowledge, game theory, and your personal golf data to suggest optimal club and target for scoring. The Caddie learns and improves the more you use Tangent."
- "Advanced automatic swing detection with best-in-class algorithms that automatically detect and measure every swing."
- "Analyzes current weather conditions, including wind, temperature, and elevation, to provide the most accurate adjusted yardages for the best club selection."
- App currently has around 80,000 users with a 4.7 rating on Apple.

**User Feedback (Positive):**
- "After using Tangent Golf, I was able to finally get a respectable score and hit my index. I realized as I was using the AI caddie, my previous rounds were a disaster because my Club selections were all wrong. I love this app!"
- "The caddie / club choice was sooo helpful and very accurate. I love geeking out and reviewing my round after. The app has great feedback and tons of things to look at."
- "After using this app my game has really improved! I have used many golf apps but there are none that have actually let me know what and where I need to improve. This app analyzes every aspect of my game. The caddie mode is excellent. No other app comes close."

**Complaints:**
- "I'll get a 135 yard shot suggestions a 6 iron, which I hit 165 to 170. Then I'll see PW for 150 yd shot that my PW is around 125." User concluded "AI caddie is a consideration but not reliable."
- Missing features like greens reading maps due to "prohibitive cost of acquiring that technology."

**Pricing:**
- Yearly access to performance functions costs $99.99 for 1 year, with a 7-day trial available.

#### Shot Scope

**Features:**
- "Purchasing a Shot Scope performance tracking product grants golfers access to the Shot Scope mobile app and web dashboard where they can access performance data, full course aerial maps, and MyStrategy with no subscription fees."
- "By tracking your performance, you can expect to reduce your scores by 4.1 shots on average, joining over 200,000 users currently using Shot Scope across the world."

**Complaints:**

1. **Battery Life**
   - "After a full charge, when they finished their round the X5 was showing 0% battery left. Expected to get at least 2 rounds on a charge for a dedicated GPS golf watch."

2. **Touch Screen Issues**
   - "The touch screen is described as 'just ok' - users found it difficult to accurately tap the specific thing they're trying to do. It can also really struggle if there's any rain or if the watch face gets wet."

3. **Limited In-Round Editing**
   - "You can't correct a shot or tell it if it's a provisional or drop during play. Some users don't want to spend 30 minutes auditing their round later and can't remember every shot."

4. **Club Detection Issues (V3)**
   - "One V3 user couldn't stand having to touch the sensor to the watch before taking a shot, otherwise it would recognize a wrong club."

**Positive Aspects:**
- "Shot Scope has nailed the value proposition - someone on a budget who doesn't want to drop $500+ on a golf watch will realize a lot of bang for their buck."
- "No ongoing subscription makes it a great option for golfers looking for a reliable GPS and shot-tracking option."

#### 18Birdies

**Features:**
- "18Birdies excels at stat tracking, with the app's powerful AI coach telling you which areas of your game need improvement."
- "Provides high-quality satellite imagery with precise distances to the green, holes, and hazards, along with wind speed and elevation data."
- Over 200,000 five-star reviews on the Apple App Store with more than 2 million active monthly users.

**Complaints:**

1. **Subscription Price**
   - "Some users find the $99 yearly subscription exorbitant, especially compared to other golf apps, particularly for golfers who only play 2-3 times a month."
   - "Users have complained that shot tracking, which was previously free, is now only available with a paid subscription."
   - "No one-time payment option to use basic functions - only costly subscription services are available."

2. **Feature Issues**
   - "The 'solid shot' feature has been called 'annoying and pretty worthless,' and some report the GPS and tracking seems less accurate than previously."
   - "Stats have no correlation to hole scores - you can record a score of 3 but enter 4 putts, 3 chips, 3 penalties and 2 sand shots without any error."
   - "Lacks automatic shot tracking using Apple Watch."

**Value Perspective:**
- "For serious golfers who want to track stats and analyze their swing, users report the app provides many insights on areas to improve, with video drills to help correct issues. These users consider the premium version worth the $100 yearly rate."
- "The free version is excellent for casual golfers, while the premium subscription is better suited for serious golfers who play frequently and want detailed analytics and coaching features."

### Competition Rule Limitations

**Critical Constraint:**
- "In golf competitions, anything that tells you what club to use or gives you distance based upon elevation would not be allowed."
- "This includes measuring elevation changes, or interpreting distance or directional information (such as using a device to get a recommended line of play or club selection based on the location of the player's ball)."
- "Devices offering club recommendations based on data analysis are prohibited in competitions."

**USGA Rules:**
- "The new rule allows both laser and GPS and (in a limited way) smartphone devices, but a player cannot utilize a device that also provides information about measurements of slope or wind speed or club recommendations."
- "The first breach of this rule means the player receives a loss of hole penalty in match play or a two-stroke penalty in stroke play. A second breach during the same round results in disqualification."

### Battery Drain and Phone Pocket Issues

**Battery Consumption:**
- "Almost every golf GPS app will drain the battery on your phone quite heavily."
- "Android users who follow battery-saving guidelines typically experience about 40-50% battery usage during an 18-hole round."

**Physical Inconvenience:**
- "Keeping your phone in your pocket during a round can be an actual physical burden. Some smartphones now are enormous, and it's not exactly optimal to have in your pocket while you swing."
- "Constantly taking your phone out and putting it back in your pocket or your golf bag/cart during a round wastes precious time, and could slow your play down and really prevent you from focusing during your pre-shot routine."

**Technical Issues:**
- "Leaving the iPhone in your bag or in your cart causes pairing disruption between your devices, triggering the constant search for a connection between your iPhone and Apple Watch, causing battery drain."
- "If you leave the screen on in your pocket, it will drain the battery very fast."

### Launch Monitor Limitations for On-Course Use

**Pace of Play:**
- "Despite its compact size, one reviewer found the Mevo+ Flightscope to be a bit of a nuisance on the course, noting it slowed down their game significantly, which is a major drawback considering the existing complaints about slow play in golf."

**Setup Requirements:**
- "For outdoor use, some monitors like the Full Swing KIT need to be placed 10 feet behind the golf ball for best radar readings."

## 3. Features Users Wish Existed for On-Course Play

### Real-Time Feedback Needs

**Immediate Shot Feedback:**
- Current technology primarily provides post-round analysis, creating a timing gap: "You still receive expert advice, but it may take hours or days to arrive. That timing gap changes how golfers learn."
- "Real-time feedback allows golfers to get instant playback during lessons to make quick, effective adjustments."
- "Real-time feedback accelerates learning by allowing you to try different adjustments and immediately understand how they affect your performance."

**Learning Style Considerations:**
- "Some golfers need real-time correction to build the right feel and make significant changes."
- "Online lessons tend to suit analytical, self-directed players who enjoy working through drills independently. In-person lessons help feel-oriented golfers who need immediate feedback, visual cues, or physical guidance to improve."

### Transfer Training Features

**Practice Like You Play:**
- "Transfer Training is where the player simulates actual playing conditions just like playing in a tournament. This type of practice involves competitive games that involve pressure or imagining playing the actual golf course on the practice range going through the exact same routine, thoughts, and movements as if playing the actual shot."
- "The gap between range and course performance isn't about swing mechanics - it's about practice methodology. When you practice like you actually play golf, with changing clubs, varying targets, consistent routines, and yardage-based short game work, your range skills finally transfer to the course."

### Course Management Tools

**Pre-Round Exploration:**
- Users appreciate features like Tangent's "Explore mode" which is "a fantastic feature to use before playing a course for the first time. You select golf, pick the course, and press Explore instead of Play. This allows you to preview the course and consider the strategy you may wish to adopt when you play."

**Smart Course Strategy:**
- "Golf courses force you to use a wider range of skills. While driving ranges primarily focus on the power and accuracy of your shots, playing on a course requires you to consider strategy, course management, and adaptability. You'll need to make decisions about club selection, shot placement, and how to handle different types of terrain and obstacles."

### Enhanced Club Recommendations

**Weather-Adjusted Yardages:**
- Users value "smart yardages" that "analyze current weather conditions, including wind, temperature, and elevation, to provide the most accurate adjusted yardages for the best club selection."
- "AI-powered yardages that take into account wind speed and slope."

**Personalized to Player Data:**
- "A smart caddie learns as you play to build a complete profile of your golf game to tell you not just what to hit, but where to hit it."
- "After logging five or more rounds, Arccos gets truly familiar with your game."

### Mental Game Support

**Pressure Management:**
- Need for tools that help bridge the gap: "Ideally, a shot on the range or on the practice putting green should be no less or no more important than a shot faced coming down the stretch in the club championship."
- "A consistent routine creates familiarity, builds your confidence, and keeps your nerves in check."

### Hands-Free/Minimal Interaction

**Ease of Use Priority:**
- "One of the things that golfers have come to value in a golf GPS app is the ease of use. They like the tools that these apps offer, but if they take more than a few seconds of their time or make it confusing to maneuver and operate the app, it's not worth it."
- "If a golf rangefinder app has an overcomplicated interface, it'll be more of a detriment than a benefit on the course."
- "Some golfers like the fact that apps like Arccos pick up on their activity on the golf course without having to input anything into the app; it's a very hands-free way to enjoy the game."
- "Best in class algorithms automatically detect and measure every swing you take with just your phone and/or Apple Watch. Experience hands-free tracking from tee to green."

### Watch Integration

**Wearable Preference:**
- "If you are looking for a GPS app with brilliant Apple Watch integration and features designed to help you improve at golf, then Tangent has to be on your shortlist."
- Users appreciate apps that work well with Apple Watch to avoid constant phone interaction.

## 4. Direct User Quotes About the Range-to-Course Gap

### The Problem Described by Users

"One of the most common phrases spoken by golfers is, 'I was hitting it so well on the range, and then I got on the course and all hell broke loose.' Some version of this conversation is going on right now all around the world. Golfers are absolutely perplexed why they can't hit the same shots during a round than they do when they are practicing."

"It's all mental. There's no pressure on the practice ground as compared to the course and so you tend to relax whereas on the course, you tense up."

"A lot of it is lack of consequence. Even if you pick a target on the range whether you hit it or not is of no consequence. On the course every shot has a consequence - missing a fairway off the tee, missing a green or missing a putt."

"The range in my opinion flatters your ball striking. A slightly fat shot off the mat will still produce a good/reasonable shot, whereas you would be punished for a similar shot on the course."

"If you practice on the range, you get good at hitting balls on the range, but it doesn't transfer to the golf course, because it isn't specific."

### User Experiences with AI Caddy Apps

#### Positive Experiences:

"After using Tangent Golf, I was able to finally get a respectable score and hit my index. I realized as I was using the AI caddie, my previous rounds were a disaster because my Club selections were all wrong. I love this app!"

"The caddie / club choice was sooo helpful and very accurate. I love geeking out and reviewing my round after. The app has great feedback and tons of things to look at."

"After using this app my game has really improved! I have used many golf apps but there are none that have actually let me know what and where I need to improve. This app analyzes every aspect of my game. The caddie mode is excellent. No other app comes close."

"I had to mess with my watch / app less which means I got to focus more on my game. The swing detection / capturing my shots and stats is easy and seamless."

"Makes tracking your progress as a golfer so much easier and gives you insights on the course you're playing. The caddie feature is awesome as sometimes you think you've grabbed the right club but a suggestion from the app can make all the difference!"

#### Negative Experiences:

"I'll get a 135 yard shot suggestions a 6 iron, which I hit 165 to 170. Then I'll see PW for 150 yd shot that my PW is around 125. AI caddie is a consideration but not reliable."

"The caddy feature doesn't factor wind direction correctly, recommending too much club on downwind holes and not enough on holes into the wind."

"Some users report it's great when it works flawlessly but rarely does in their experience. They get fed up with sensors not working and found the caddie to not be very smart."

"The Apple Watch app has been described as 'beyond awful,' registering maybe two shots all round with a clunky sync process."

### Technology Frustrations

"If you're using Arccos you can't simultaneously connect to a Bluetooth speaker and listen to music."

"The phone in the front pocket is a common problem for users."

"You can't correct a shot or tell it if it's a provisional or drop during play. Some users don't want to spend 30 minutes auditing their round later and can't remember every shot."

"The touch screen is described as 'just ok' - users found it difficult to accurately tap the specific thing they're trying to do. It can also really struggle if there's any rain or if the watch face gets wet."

"Keeping your phone in your pocket during a round can be an actual physical burden. Some smartphones now are enormous, and it's not exactly optimal to have in your pocket while you swing."

### Course Management Insights

"Too many golfers are just not used to being on the course, and their nerves get the best of them because they don't have enough experience. For golfers who don't have that much time to play, they should realize that they are expecting way too much of themselves if they think they can bring their range game out on the course."

"Fatigue, frustration, even hunger can sneak in and lead to poor decisions, especially on the back nine. Good course management means recognizing when you're fading."

## 5. What Users Would Pay for On-Course Assistance

### Current Subscription Pricing

**Premium Golf App Subscriptions:**
- Arccos Caddie: $99/year (after first year free with sensor purchase)
- Tangent Golf: $99.99/year (with 7-day trial)
- 18Birdies Premium: $5/month or $45/year
- Shot Scope: No subscription (one-time hardware purchase)

### User Value Perceptions

#### Willing to Pay:

"For serious golfers who want to track stats and analyze their swing, users report the app provides many insights on areas to improve, with video drills to help correct issues. These users consider the premium version worth the $100 yearly rate."

"After more than 50 posted rounds, they can 'absolutely recommend that 18Birdies is worth every cent to purchase to use all of the features.'"

"The user experience is top notch and when you consider how much is available without even paying for the premium membership, it's a no-brainer for any golfer to give it a try."

#### Price Resistance:

"Some users find the $99 yearly subscription exorbitant, especially compared to other golf apps, particularly for golfers who only play 2-3 times a month."

"The ongoing subscription fee gives some users pause - part of the concern is 'continually paying $99 year after year.'"

"Many golfers wouldn't pay for a basic golf GPS app at this point since there are too many free options out there."

"The pricing starts to go up when you want green reading functionality, club selections, game tracking, and more."

One user complained "Waste of 5 dollars" for a basic Golf Caddy app.

### Value Proposition That Works

**No Subscription Model:**
- Shot Scope's approach resonates: "One long-term user reports having absolutely no problems with the V5, and the fact that there is no ongoing subscription makes it a great option for golfers looking for a reliable GPS and shot-tracking option."
- "Shot Scope has nailed the value proposition - someone on a budget who doesn't want to drop $500+ on a golf watch will realize a lot of bang for their buck with the V5."

**Hybrid Approach:**
- 18Birdies' freemium model works: "The free version is excellent for casual golfers, while the premium subscription is better suited for serious golfers who play frequently and want detailed analytics and coaching features."

### Hardware Investment Tolerance

**Initial Sensor Costs:**
- Arccos Smart Sensors: $250 USD
- Arccos Caddie Link: Additional $99
- Shot Scope systems: $69-$299 (one-time purchase)
- Garmin CT10 club sensors: $300

**Launch Monitors:**
- Users are willing to pay $1,799-$2,399 for robotic caddies (Robera NEO) at 40% off retail
- Professional-grade launch monitors are used, but portability for on-course use remains a limitation

### Willingness to Pay Factors

1. **Frequency of Play**: Casual golfers (2-3 rounds/month) resist $99/year subscriptions
2. **Data Depth**: Users willing to pay for "strokes gained" analytics and detailed performance insights
3. **Accuracy**: Unreliable club recommendations quickly erode perceived value
4. **Ease of Use**: Clunky interfaces and technical issues reduce willingness to renew
5. **Competition Rules**: Features that can't be used in tournaments reduce value for competitive golfers

## Key Insights Summary

1. **The Range-to-Course Gap is Real and Pervasive**: Nearly every golfer experiences the frustration of practice not transferring to play, driven by environmental differences, lack of consequences, pressure, and mental factors.

2. **Existing Tools Have Significant Limitations**: While AI caddy apps like Arccos, Tangent, and Shot Scope offer valuable features, they suffer from technical issues (sensor reliability, battery drain, connectivity), accuracy problems (wind calculations, club recommendations), and usability friction (phone in pocket, clunky interfaces).

3. **Users Want Real-Time, Not Post-Round Feedback**: The timing gap between making a shot and receiving coaching feedback is a fundamental limitation. Golfers need immediate corrections to build proper feel and make adjustments during play.

4. **Hands-Free Operation is Critical**: Phone-in-pocket requirements, constant screen interaction, and clunky interfaces detract from the playing experience and slow pace of play.

5. **Competition Rules Constrain Features**: Many desired features (slope-adjusted distances, club recommendations, wind analysis) are prohibited in competitive play, limiting the value for tournament golfers.

6. **Subscription Fatigue is Real**: While serious golfers will pay $99/year for comprehensive features, casual players resist ongoing costs. The Shot Scope model (no subscription) resonates strongly.

7. **Accuracy Determines Value**: When AI caddy recommendations are wrong (especially club selection), users quickly lose trust and perceive the tool as worthless regardless of other features.

8. **Mental Game Support is Underserved**: Tools that help golfers manage pressure, build routines, and simulate tournament conditions during practice could address a significant unmet need in bridging the practice-to-play gap.
