# Research Documentation

**Important**: The research documents have been reorganized!

---

## ⚠️ Documentation Has Moved

Research documents are no longer organized by source type. They have been **consolidated into topic-based comprehensive guides** for better usability.

### New Location: [`docs/guides/`](../guides/index.md)

---

## Quick Navigation to New Guides

Instead of scattered research documents, use these consolidated guides:

### 🤖 [Pose Estimation & Computer Vision](../guides/pose-estimation.md)

**Consolidates**: pose-estimation-tools, visual-feedback-apis (pose section), commercial-fitness-tech (vision), datasets (COCO/MPII/Fit3D), ML frameworks
**For**: ML engineers, backend developers

### 🎨 [Visual Feedback Design](../guides/visual-feedback-design.md)

**Consolidates**: visual-feedback-research-summary, UI/UX guidelines, visual-feedback-apis (rendering), commercial UX patterns
**For**: UI/UX designers, frontend developers

### 🔧 [Sensor Hardware & Embedded Systems](../guides/sensor-hardware.md)

**Consolidates**: hardware-comparison, IMU/MCU decisions, datasets (sensor data), commercial sensors, EMG unique value
**For**: Hardware engineers, embedded developers

### 📱 [Mobile App Development](../guides/mobile-development.md)

**Consolidates**: mobile-frameworks-comparison, Flutter decision, UI/UX (mobile), mobile SDKs, pose estimation (mobile)
**For**: Mobile developers

### 📊 [Datasets & Benchmarking](../guides/datasets-benchmarking.md)

**Consolidates**: academic-research-datasets, benchmarks, commercial performance metrics
**For**: Researchers, ML engineers

### 🏆 [Competitive Analysis & Strategy](../guides/competitive-analysis.md)

**Consolidates**: project-unique-value, commercial-fitness-tech, movement-feedback-commercial-research
**For**: Leadership, investors, strategy

## Why the Change?

**Old structure** (source-based):

```text
docs/research/
├── pose-estimation-tools-2025.md
├── visual-feedback-research-summary.md
├── commercial-fitness-tech.md
├── academic-research-datasets.md
└── ... (20+ scattered documents)
```

**Problem**: Working on pose estimation? Read 7 different documents! 😞

**New structure** (topic-based):

```text
docs/guides/
├── pose-estimation.md           ← Everything about pose estimation
├── visual-feedback-design.md    ← Everything about visual feedback
├── sensor-hardware.md           ← Everything about sensors
└── ... (6 comprehensive guides)
```

**Solution**: Working on pose estimation? Read ONE comprehensive guide! 😊

## Archived Research Documents

Original research documents are preserved for historical reference:

📂 **[`docs/archive/research-sources/`](../archive/research-sources/index.md)**

These files are **frozen** as of December 1, 2025. Do NOT edit them.

For updates, edit the corresponding guide in `docs/guides/` instead.
